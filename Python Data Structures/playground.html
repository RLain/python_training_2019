  <strong>The Financial Intelligence Centre Act </strong>(FICA) was implemented
  in 2001 in order to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism. In
  order to comply with this act, we'll need to verify your identity. 
</p>
<p>
  The way we verify FICA varies depending on which method you receive your card
  reader. To check which method applies to you, head to the relevant section below:

  If your Wireless Card Reader isn't reading chip cards, here are some troubleshooting
  tips that might help fix the problem:
</p>
<hr align="center" size="8" width="100%">
<ol class="list-colored">
  <li>
    First, please make sure you're
    <strong>entering the card into the reader the correct way around</strong>.
    The card should be facing up, numbers visible with the chip inside the card
    reader as illustrated below. <br><br><a class="image-with-lightbox" href="/hc/article_attachments/360000493269/s_026760084234B4CFF3025F729B8114F6C726D4468BC05D597A833ABCAF6B2690_1476706926822_Screen_Shot_2016-10-17_at_14.21.56.png"><img src="/hc/article_attachments/360000493269/s_026760084234B4CFF3025F729B8114F6C726D4468BC05D597A833ABCAF6B2690_1476706926822_Screen_Shot_2016-10-17_at_14.21.56.png"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    If you're definitely entering the card correctly and the reader is still
    not reading chip cards,
    <strong>please retry the transaction with a different card</strong>. The
    chips on cards wear down with constant use and can also get damaged.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a new card is also not working,
    <strong>please take a torch or bright light, and look inside of the reader slot, to see if there is anything stuck inside</strong>.

  Your Wireless Card Reader power button is what you use to power up and power
  down your card reader. On the
  <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="/hc/en-za/articles/115005093189-Choosing-the-right-Yoco-Wireless-Card-Reader#the-wireless-pro">Wireless Pro</a></span>,
  it's the blue button on the top right of the reader, and on the
  <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="/hc/en-za/articles/115005093189-Choosing-the-right-Yoco-Wireless-Card-Reader#the-wireless-lite">Wireless Lite</a></span>,
  it's the black button to the left of the card reader. <br><br>Sometimes, for
  a variety of reasons, this power button can get stuck.
</p>
<h3>What happens when the button is stuck?</h3>
<hr align="center" size="8" width="100%">
<p>
  When the power button gets stuck inside the reader the reader gets caught in
  a limbo state. 
</p>
<p>
  <em class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></em> You won't be able to transact with
  the reader.
</p>
<p>
  <em class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></em> You won't be able to reset the reader.
</p>
<p>
  <em class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></em> The green lights on the top of the
  reader will flash whilst the reader has battery power.
</p>
<p>
  <em class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></em> Once the battery has drained you
  won't be able to turn it on.
</p>
<h3>Causes, and how to fix it</h3>
<hr align="center" size="8" width="100%">
<p>
  We will first outline how power buttons get stuck inside the reader. The power
  on the Wireless Pro sits flush with the casing of the reader. This means when
  the button is depressed and moved at an angle it can get stuck under the lip
  of the power button hole.
</p>
<h4>
  This happens when a smaller object that the button is used to turn the reader
  on/off such as:
</h4>
<p>
  <em class="fa fa-ban"></em> A finger Nail
</p>
<p>
  <em class="fa fa-ban"></em> A pen
</p>
<p>
  When the button gets stuck, we don't recommend using a pen, knife or similarly
  sized object to try and force it out. This will permanently damage the power
  button and create rough edges, which will get stuck time and time again. <br><br>As
  illustrated below, to get the button unstuck, simply use your nail and push the
  button down, and then back.
</p>
<p>
  <a class="image-with-lightbox" href="/hc/article_attachments/360000492969/mceclip0.png"><img src="/hc/article_attachments/360000492969/mceclip0.png"></a>
</p>
<p>
  Once you've unstuck the button, make sure you're only using the pad of your finger
  to turn the reader on and off. This will prevent the button from moving under
  the casing lip. <br><br>It's very rare for power buttons on the Wireless Lite
  to get stuck as the structure of the button is different. In the event the button
  does get stuck, please try the same method.
</p>
<div class="callout callout--warning callout--dashed">
  <p>
    <em class="fa fa-info-circle"></em><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If you're
    not able to get the button unstuck yourself, please
    <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="/hc/en-za/requests/new">get in touch</a></span>
    with us. Our logistics team will arrange a refurbished replacement card reader
    for you, and collect the reader with the stuck button for assessment.
